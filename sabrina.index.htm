        <p style="color: rgb(96, 73, 199);"> I am a big fan of  Sabrina Carpenter. She is a great actress and singer. She has lots of followers on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Also, her voice is so cool. She is one of the brilliant singers in the world. furthermore, she is a good actress and to be honest she is a fucking pretty. It’s funny yeah I don’t really mean to say that, but she is gorges. I really admire her.Sabrina Carpenter has been described as a "teen pop" singer who has explored through other genres on different albums including pop, folk pop, acoustic and country on Eyes Wide Open. Evolution included genres such as electropop and house music. Singular: Act I and Singular: Act II dived into "more mature" genres and lyrical content including dance-pop, trap, hip-hop and R&B.Carpenter's debut EP, Can't Blame a Girl for Trying, was released in 2014, and in the same year, she released her debut single of the same name. She released her debut album, Eyes Wide Open in 2015, and has since released another three studio albums: Evolution (2016), Singular: Act I (2018), and her most recent studio album, Singular: Act II, was released on July 19, 2019.</p>
